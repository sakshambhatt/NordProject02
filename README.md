# NordProject

NordProject is a take home project given by Nord Finance. In this project I have to display a paginated table which can be sorted and searched through.

## Application links:

1. [Source code - github](https://github.com/sakshambhatt/NordProject02)
2. [Hosted Link - netlify](https://nord-project.netlify.app/)
3. [Codesandbox ](https://codesandbox.io/s/nordproject-q1vvj)

## Setup and running locally:
1. nodeJS 14.x or later should be installed on your system.
2. Open the repository in terminal and type `npm start`
3. The app should start at localhost:3000

## Technologies used:

1. ReactJS
2. axios
3. uuid
4. Styling: CSS
5. Deployment: CI/ CD pipeline using Netlify

## Functionalities:

1. Paginated table of 10 records
2. Traverse records by next and previous buttons
3. show bio-data of beings
4. sort by height and mass of beings
5. search by name of beings

## Test coverage:

I have yet to learn jest and mocha. So, there are no test cases written for this app.

## What could be improved?

1. State management could be done in a better way using either Redux or Redux toolkit. Which I have an understanding of, but am not well versed in.
2. Multiple renderings are triggered by change in state variable of state hooks and all, this could be optimized
3. Pagination could be implemented in a standard way
